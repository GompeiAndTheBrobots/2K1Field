RBE 2001 Field Computer Replicator
==================================

An android app to replace the RBE 2001 field, and provide awesome debugging features!
At WPI, we have a Robotics class where little arduino robots are controlled by a field-computer over bluetooth.
Previously, this field computer was an Arduino Mega with a big expensive shield. Our project superseeds that previous system, and allows students to debug and test without an actual field computer!
